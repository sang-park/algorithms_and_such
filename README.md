## PRACTICE

This repository contains exercises that are designed to stimulate the minds of programmers. Note that the methods written out here are not the only ways to solve the problems, and there may be far more efficient solutions. If you come across any errors, or a better solution, feel free to message me! It will also (eventually) contain basic algorithm problems and walkthroughs as well.
